### {% icon fa-question-circle-o%} So, why the blog?

As a child, I started dabbling with computers. I remember going into a store when I must have been 8 or 9, walking up to a demo [Sinclair ZX81](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX81), and typing in _"what is your name?"_.

Sadly, I didn't get the sentient response I had expected, (one day... one day, I will...) but it started my fascination with anything technology.

Since then, I've picked up a lot of things I have done to make it easier to work with technology, and get it do what I wanted, not what it wanted. So I thought, makes sense to write some of it down.

That's pretty much it.
