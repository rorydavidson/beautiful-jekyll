My name is **Rory Davidson** and I live near Cambridge in the UK.

#### {% icon fa-industry%}  Work

I'm the Executive Lead for Technical Services for SNOMED International, a non-profit organization responsible for managing the SNOMED CT clinical terminology. Read more about that on the {% extlink SNOMED International website http://www.snomed.org %}.

This gives me the opportunity to dabble in and around a number of technologies, but more importantly to make sure that everything we do is available under an Apache v2 open source license in the {% extlink organization's GitHub repos https://github.com/IHTSDO %}.

#### {% icon fa-book%}  Topics that interest me
(and that I am likely to talk about)
- Healthcare IT
- Standards (SNOMED CT, HL7 FHIR, and more)
- Open source software
- Machine learning
- IoT
- Solving difficult problems with technology
- The impact of technology once the problems are solved and new ones are created

Generally, pretty much anything outside of today's divisive politics.


#### {% icon fa-history%}  My history

Been in the game since 1995, working with technology across many industries and countries, but settling into healthcare in 2005. If you're really interested in more detail, it's on {% extlink LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/rorydavidson %}

#### The rest
I run, or rather used to run a lot until age caught up with me and my knees starting just saying _no_, but I still get out when I can. In 2010, I ran the {% extlink Marathon Des Sables http://www.marathondessables.com %}, which seemed like a good idea at the time.

Some have asked what the avatar image is... it's a {% extlink Fidget Cube https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/antsylabs/fidget-cube-a-vinyl-desk-toy %}. Just get one...
